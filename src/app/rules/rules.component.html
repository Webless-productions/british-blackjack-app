      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Gameplay:</h2>
      <p>The player to the dealer's left goes first. On a player's turn, they must do one of the following:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Play a card matching the discard in number, value, or suit.</li>
        <li>Play a suited King, Queen, 8, 2, Jack, Ace, or Joker.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Play continues in a clockwise direction, or counterclockwise if a King (Reverse) is played.</p>
  
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Special Card Rules:</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li><strong>2s:</strong> When a 2 is played, the next player must pick up the number of cards specified (2 cards unless stacked).</li>
        <li><strong>8s:</strong> When an 8 is played, the next player loses their turn (is "skipped").</li>
        <li><strong>Jacks:</strong> If a black Jack is played, the next player must pick up 5 cards. If a red Jack is played immediately after a black Jack, it cancels the pick up 5 cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Queens:</strong> When a Queen is played, it must be covered by a card of the same suit on the next turn. If the next player cannot play a card of the same suit, they must draw a card from the deck.</li>
        <li><strong>Kings:</strong> When a King is played, the direction of play is reversed (clockwise to counterclockwise, or vice versa).</li>
        <li><strong>Aces:</strong> These are wild cards that can be played on any card. The player who plays an Ace gets to choose the suit that continues play.</li>
        <li><strong>Jokers:</strong> If your deck includes Jokers, they can become any card, meaning the player can decide what card (and hence what action) the Joker represents.</li>
      </ul>
